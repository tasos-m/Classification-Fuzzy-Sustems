# Computational Intelligence - Classification Assignment

In this assignment, fuzzy TSK models are built to fit nonlineaar, multivariable functions, in order to solve classification problem.

## Part 1
The first part of the assignment is about the training process and the evaluation of four models. 
>Dataset used: [Haberman's Survival Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/haberman's+survival) 

During the experiment these 4 models were tested:
* **TSK Model 1:** Subtractive clustering at the training data (class independent method) & Range of influence of the cluster center = 0.2 → 23 rules
* **TSK Model 2:** Subtractive clustering at the training data (class independent method) & Range of influence of the cluster center = 0.8 →  3 rules
* **TSK Model 3:** Subtractive clustering at the training data for each class separately
* **TSK Model 4:**
